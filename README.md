# Checkers

Description

This is a simple implementation of a checkers game that I used as a way to solidify the skills that I learned in my programming classes. I made an original version after taking
a fundimentals class, but rewrote it to incorporate OOP concepts and to use the Swing library (as opposed to the course-specific library that I had used prior).  A large emphasis
of this project was flexibility and extensibility, which I achieved through my usage of MVC.  This allows my code to be loosely coupled, andcould allow for additional views
(such as an ASCII view), controllers (perhaps one with a timer), and models.  I also employed the Strategy design pattern when implementing my ruleset to allow for many rulesets
to exist (such as one that does not allow double jumping).  Writing this code served as a good refresher to OOP principles and also was an exercise in understanding and improving
some of my older code.

Running the Code

This code can be downloaded and then run on any Java IDE via the CheckersMain method.
